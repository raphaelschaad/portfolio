One More Thing is a conference in Australia for iOS developers and designers, where I was invited to speak about my work on Flipboard.

The talk is structured in three acts: about teaming up with great people, about developing and shipping products, and about ideas.

Previous to the conference, I had [a splendid conversation with Peter Wells and Marc Edwards](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/raphael-schaad-flipboard/id511706732?i=113941803&mt=2) about how I got into iOS development, and my work on [iA Writer](ia-writer) and [Flipboard](flipboard). On working at a startup in [Silicon Valley](booklet-silicon-valley), encountering my tech heroes in daily life, and my approach to blending engineering and design. And how growing up in a country with four different languages formed my sensibility for clear communication with symbols.

Interfaces of the past feature different physical controls such as buttons or knobs and in the future they will too recognize a multitude of gestures. But today we interact with products predominantly by touching a glass surface. *The challenge and opportunity is to design interfaces that are inspired by the tactile reality yet open to imagination beyond that*.

![Media Control Interface History](images/morphing-interface/media-control-interface-history.jpg)

The dominant design for media *Play* and *Pause* controls emerged a while ago, however, the way we interact with these functions changed over time: cassette decks had the functions on separate buttons. *Pause* left the play head in contact with the magnetic tape and only *Stop* released the heads and disconnected the wheel motor from power to prevent damages. Digital players could then combine *Play/Pause* into a single toggle button with both icons on it. On-screen buttons can now change their appearance to only show the relevant icon at a time.

When such a change of state occurs and the interface on screen just snaps in place, I see a lost opportunity of the new possibilities to maintain continuity. The interface can transition itself over time to provide meaning and even delight. **The Play/Pause button is an example I explored of this broader principle I see emerge. The affordance to toggle the established iconography lead me to morph between them. By sketching the transition of the vertices I came up with different styles, implemented them with CoreAnimation, and released [a new UI control for iOS](https://github.com/raphaelschaad/RSPlayPauseButton)** as free and unencumbered software into the public domain.

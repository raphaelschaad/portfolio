*Flipboard Briefing* is the news app integrated into the OS for all Samsung Galaxy Note 4 devices world-wide. It is built and powered by [Flipboard](flipboard), and in this collaboration with Samsung **I lead the design, prototyped interactions, and managed the production** within a 3 months timeframe.

To describe my process, I show select artifacts of several stages of the development. One can discover specific ideas developing through each stage up to the final product.

In the initial phase, **sketching** serves two main purposes: it helps to communicate ideas efficiently to other people for further discussion and it is the first step in developing specific screens and interactions without already committing to them.

When **designing** specific screens, high-fidelity mockups with real data paint the clearest picture and help during engineering. Having engineered complex interfaces myself, I write specs as a designer that describe the complex dimension of an idea beyond its mockup, useful for engineers during implementation.

For custom user flows, interactive **prototyping** is important to go beyond static mockups. This is where I fully leverage my engineering background to program prototypes that explore completely new interactions or move an experience from “works” to “delightful”.

Managing **production** involves many tasks such as coordinating, exporting assets, or even cutting features, to assure quality and deliver a great end result. *“Real artists ship”* —Steve Jobs

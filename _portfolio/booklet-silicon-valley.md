Two years after moving from an Alp Valley to Silicon Valley, I wrote a booklet about that experience. It describes startup life and what goes into building Flipboard. It touches on diversity in San Francisco and American urban design. Finally, I share my adventure of living in a van and losing everything I possessed.

It is designed for print and was sent to friends and family.
